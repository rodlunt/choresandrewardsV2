The issue occurred because seedDefaultChores() was being\ncalled immediately after openDB() returned, but the upgrade transaction\nwas still committing in the background.\n\nWhen users clicked on a child card:\n1. getDB() was called for the first time\n2. openDB() started a version upgrade transaction\n3. openDB() promise resolved immediately\n4. seedDefaultChores() attempted to create a new transaction\n5. ERROR: \"A version change transaction is running\"\n6. This caused data loading to fail\n7. React reconciliation failed with inconsistent hook renders\n8. Result: React error 310\n\nTHE FIX:\n1. Added setTimeout(0) to wait for upgrade transaction to commit\n2. Added isSeeding flag to prevent concurrent seeding attempts\n3. Wrapped seeding in try/finally to ensure flag is reset\n\nThis ensures the upgrade transaction is fully committed before\nany other database operations are attempted.\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS:\n- openDB() resolves when upgrade callback returns\n- BUT the upgrade transaction continues to commit asynchronously\n- setTimeout(0) yields to event loop, allowing commit to complete\n- This prevents InvalidStateError on transaction creation\n\nsw.js - Bump to v14 to force cache refresh\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
