The production deployment uses Docker containers which:\n- Install all dependencies during the Docker build process (via \\`npm ci\\`)\n- Include all node_modules within the container image\n- Do not require local node_modules on the host machine\n\n**Production Status:**\n- âœ… Docker container building successfully\n- âœ… All dependencies installed in container\n- âœ… App running at https://www.choresandrewards.app/\n- âœ… Latest dependency updates deployed (see issue #7)\n\n**For Local Development:**\nIf you need to run the app locally (outside Docker), you would need to run \\`npm install\\` in the project directory. However, this is not required for the current Docker-based production deployment.\")",
