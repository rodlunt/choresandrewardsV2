The container chores-rewards-app stopped running because of a ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND error in the Node.js application. This error indicates that the application attempted to import or require a module that could not be found. The issue is likely related to missing or improperly resolved dependencies.

Key Details:
Exit Code: 1 - This typically indicates a general application error.
Error Log:
The error ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND suggests that the application is trying to load a module that is either not installed or not correctly referenced in the code.
The stack trace points to the Node.js internal module resolution process failing.
Node.js Version: 20.19.4 - The application is running on this version, so compatibility issues with the Node.js version could also be a factor.
Restarting Behavior: The container is in a restarting loop due to the unless-stopped restart policy.
Likely Causes:
Missing Dependencies: The required module might not be installed. This could happen if npm install was not run or if the node_modules directory is missing.
Incorrect Import Path: The application might be referencing a module with an incorrect or relative path.
Incompatible Node.js Version: The application might depend on features or modules incompatible with Node.js v20.19.4.
Suggested Fixes:
Check Dependencies:

Ensure all dependencies are installed by running npm install in the application directory.
Verify that the package.json file includes all required dependencies.
Validate Import Paths:

Review the code to ensure all module import paths are correct and resolve to existing files.
Node.js Compatibility:

Confirm that the application is compatible with Node.js v20.19.4. If not, consider downgrading Node.js or updating the application code.
Inspect Build Process:

If the image was built using a Dockerfile, ensure that the node_modules directory is not excluded (e.g., via .dockerignore) and that dependencies are installed during the build process.
By addressing these issues, the container should stop restarting and run successfully.
