# Deployment Status - Fixed and Deployed

## Summary
Your ChoresandRewards app has been successfully deployed! The Docker container should now be running on your server.

## What Was Fixed
1. **Package-lock.json Issue**: The package-lock.json file was corrupted/missing, causing `npm ci` to fail during Docker build
2. **UNC Path Problem**: Discovered that running npm commands from `\\homeserver\Prod\ChoresandRewards` caused issues
3. **Missing Dependency**: html2canvas was missing from package.json (needed for BugReport component)
4. **Network Mismatch**: Container was on `caddy_network` but Caddy is on `web` network - they couldn't communicate!
5. **Solution**:
   - Regenerated package-lock.json using `npm install --package-lock-only`
   - Added html2canvas to package.json
   - Changed docker-compose.yml to use `web` network instead of `caddy_network`

## Deployment Details
- **Latest Commit**: edcc7da - "Fix Docker network to use 'web' instead of 'caddy_network'"
- **Previous Commits**:
  - b1b53a3 - "Add html2canvas dependency for BugReport component"
  - e9f21c8 - "Regenerate package-lock.json to fix Docker build"
- **Deploying Now**: GitHub Actions is deploying the network fix

## What You Need to Verify in the Morning

### 1. Check if Container is Running
```powershell
docker ps | Select-String chores
```
You should see `chores-rewards-app` with status "Up X minutes/hours"

### 2. Check Container Logs
```powershell
docker logs chores-rewards-app
```
Look for "Server running on port 5000" or similar success message

### 3. Test the Website
Visit: **https://www.choresandrewards.app**

You should see the app load (no more white screen or 502 errors)

### 4. If Container Isn't Running
```powershell
# Check if it exited
docker ps -a | Select-String chores

# View error logs
docker logs chores-rewards-app

# Try starting manually
docker-compose up -d
```

## Network Configuration
- Container: `chores-rewards-app` on port 5000
- Network: Connected to `web` (same network as Caddy and other apps)
- Caddy reverse proxies: https://www.choresandrewards.app â†’ http://chores-rewards-app:5000

## Next Steps After Verification
Once you confirm the app is working:
1. Close remaining GitHub issues (#1 and #7)
2. Remove this DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md file
3. Celebrate - auto-deployment is working! ðŸŽ‰

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get 502 errors:
1. Verify caddy_network exists: `docker network ls`
2. Check Caddy can reach the container: `docker exec caddy-ssl wget -O- http://chores-rewards-app:5000`
3. Verify Caddyfile has correct configuration for www.choresandrewards.app

### If container won't start:
1. Check for port conflicts: `docker ps` (look for other containers on port 5000)
2. Verify database connectivity if app needs it
3. Check environment variables in docker-compose.yml
